# Retro-Calculator
An iOS9 calculator with a retro feel.


About:

Created by Nate Karabensh on 4/26/16 for iOS9 using Swift 2.2 on xCode 7.3. The app works on both iPad and iPhones of all sizes, but looks best graphically on the iPhone screens.

This is a calculator that completes standard functions such as Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. There is an option to clear the memory, similar to other calculators.
The calculator is "floating" in space. "Why?", you may ask -- Why not? The launch screen features a view from the surface of a Mars-like planet. The actual calculator is attracted by the moon's (of Earth) gravitational pull and resides on its surface.
